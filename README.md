# TitanForge
Titanforge is a budget 3D printer that is designed around printing TPU and filled Nylons, which many entry level printers struggle to print without heavy modification.

## Goals

My initial goals when I set out to design this printer were as follow:
- Nylon capable
- Enclosed (not in current design due to time constraints, but can easily be added in after its built)
- Hardened Extruder Gears
- All Metal Hotend
- 300C+ Hotend
- Heated Bed
- Direct Drive

Some other features that I wanted, but did not prioritize as highly were:
- CoreXY
- Klipper
- Automatic Bed Leveling
- 300mm wide bed
- Dual Material (was not implemented due to price/complexity)
- Touch screen (not implemented due to price)
- At least a 250mm square bed
